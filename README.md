# Readme: Exercise 1


# 1. K-fold Validation -> correct
# 2. Way of prediction -> correct
 <del>The instruction says that we need to make predition while going to calculate K-nearest neighbors at the same time.
 But I did find the opitmal calculate of K at the first, and then made prediction with its K.
 I will ask TA on it.</del>
 
 I got the data of the prediction of price by each fold.
 
# 3. The part of "Which trim yields a larger optimal value of K? Why do you think this is?" -> update
 I thought the reason of the larger optimal K for AWG is the difference of the number of observations.
